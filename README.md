## Project Description

This project aims to develop a machine learning model that can accurately differentiate between images of birds and drones. The CNN model is trained on a dataset of labeled bird and drone images, with an emphasis on data augmentation to improve accuracy. The project evaluates the model's performance using ROC curves and confusion matrices, and determines an optimal threshold for binary classification.

## Key Features

- CNN model for image classification
- Data augmentation techniques for improved accuracy
- Evaluation using ROC curves and confusion matrices
- Optimal threshold determination for binary classification

## Project Structure

- `data/`: Directory containing image datasets (train, validation, test)
- `models/`: Directory containing model architecture definitions
- `train.py`: Script to train the CNN model
- `evaluate.py`: Script to evaluate model performance
- `utils.py`: Utility functions for data preprocessing and visualization

## Getting Started

1. Clone this repository: `git clone https://github.com/your-username/bird-drone-classifier.git`
2. Set up a virtual environment and install dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
3. Organize your image dataset in the `data/` directory (train, validation, test subdirectories).
4. Adjust model hyperparameters and configurations in the relevant script.
5. Run `train.py` to train the model and save checkpoints.
6. Run `evaluate.py` to evaluate model performance and visualize results.
